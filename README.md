# C-Programming-Snakes-and-Ladders
[2021-22] C programming module

The goal of this project is to implement a C application which can simulate a game of snakes and ladders. Snakes and ladders is a board game based on random chance. The player must navigate from the start of the board (square 1) to the final square (square n). The player can move forward a fixed number of squares based on the outcome of a single die roll; moves between 1 and 6 steps forward are possible with a 6-sided die.
Along the path there are a fixed number of snakes and ladders. If a player moves to a space with a ladder they can move directly forward to the space at the other side of the ladder. This brings them closer to the final square. If a player moves to a space with a snake they must move directly back to the space at the other side of the snake. This brings them further away from the final square.
